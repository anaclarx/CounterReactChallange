# Fibonacci Counter

This project was a coding challenge using React. Below are the specifications: 
    Your mission is to craft a React application featuring a counter with an increment button.
    - The application should meet the following requirements:
        -Fibonacci Suite Indicator: Display a clear signal next to the counter if its current value aligns with a Fibonacci sequence number.
        -Threshold Alerts: As the counter approaches a predefined threshold, trigger a user-friendly alert to notify the user about its proximity to a higher value.
        -Threshold Lock: Upon crossing a secondary threshold, prevent further counter increments. Provide a user-friendly explanation for this limitation.
The Project can be found in the digital-ocean-tutorial folder since it was constructed using Create React App Template  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run it: (Make sure you have node and npm available at your local environment)
    git clone https://github.com/anaclarx/CounterReactChallange.git
    cd digital-ocean-tutorial
    npm start

It will automatically open a localhost web page in your default browser.
